💳 Credit-Debit Analytics
The Credit-Debit Analytics module is a key component of the Bank Analytics Dashboard, designed to analyze and visualize customer transaction patterns. This section provides in-depth insights into credit and debit activities across various customer segments, helping financial institutions monitor transaction behaviors, identify high-volume users, and detect unusual activity.

All data for this module was processed using SQL, where queries were written to filter, aggregate, and organize transaction records by type, frequency, and time. The insights are presented through interactive dashboards built in Power BI, Tableau, and Excel, allowing users to explore credit and debit trends across months, customer age groups, account types, and regions.
